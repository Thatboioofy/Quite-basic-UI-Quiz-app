# Quite-basic-UI-Quiz-app [Pre-release]
(Also sorry for the bad spelling)
A fairly basic and badly written Quiz app with somwhat working customisations

This program is really badly written and will be broken sometimes when im adding new features but it also now has a conf file making it easier to make your own quiz using it.

This also requires both CustomTKinter and configparser to be installed to work (You can search up on how to install them)

This is a pre-release and is still being updated to get all the fucntions from the old UI into the new one.
Please report anybugs so I can attempt to fix them
